## Fanbook Password Checker

A social media site named **fanbook** has over a million user. Most of the user don't have strong password. As a result hacker can easily guess the password and log into user's account.

The company decided to set some rules for user password so that hacker can't guess easily. They want to hire you to build a password checker.

**Password should have:**
- At least 8 digit
- Contain at least one Uppercase, Lowercase and special character
- First digit can't be number

Make a checker that can validate the password and if anything missing on the password your checker should give specific message to user what's missing.
